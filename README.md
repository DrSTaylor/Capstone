The under-18 population decline combined with the decline in college enrollment for 18-24-year-olds has colleges taking a hard look at their strategies for recruitment and retention. This project explores one possible recruitment and retention strategy for education majors at a Midwest university, a laboratory school. The open-ended responses collected annually over the last four years indicate a strong positive sentiment when asked about the influence of the lab school on the decision (recruitment) to attend or continue attending (retention). The top 3 words in recruitment are school, experience, and classroom, and in retention, they are teacher, classroom, and student. Polarity was used to determine the top 3 responses in each dataset. This analysis is one component of a larger project examining the influence of the lab school on recruitment and retention.
